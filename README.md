# WhisperBox

WhisperBox is a low-profile, offline-first education and information delivery system designed for girls living under regimes where digital freedom is restricted or erased.

This project is in early-stage development. The goal is to build a secure, deployable toolkit that operates entirely without internet access â€” delivering educational resources, critical health and safety information, and localized support tools in environments where surveillance and censorship are the norm.

### Core Principles
- **Offline by default.** Must function in zero connectivity environments.
- **Discreet.** Looks like nothing, acts like everything.
- **Modular.** Easy to update, adapt, or localize.
- **Feminist by design.** Built specifically for those targeted by structural oppression.

### Roadmap (WIP)
- Hardware prototyping (low-cost SBCs, power options)
- Local content distribution (USB, Bluetooth, mesh)
- UI/UX for minimal risk + high usability
- Security testing in high-risk threat models

### Status
Exploration + infrastructure. Research ongoing.
